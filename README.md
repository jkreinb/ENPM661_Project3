## ENPM661 Project3

Project demonstrating A* algorithm and visualizing the route using matlibplot

## Dependencies:

* __time__ - tracks computation time

* __numpy__ - general matrix operations

* __heapq__ - binary tree generation

* __cv2__ - visualization

* __math__ - matrix math operations

## Instructions:

1. Run program.
2. Enter robot radius and clearance around outside of robot
3. Enter Goal location per prompts
4. Enter Starting location per prompts
5. Switch to the created image "actual_image" and press key "0"
6. Obstacles are shown in blue, and will grow proportional to clearance & robot radius
   Red pixels will show which nodes have been explored by the A* algorithm
   White pixels will show the final optimal path
7. When visualization is complete press "0" key to close window and complete program.

## Outputs:

* Visualization window

* No text outputs
